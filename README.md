## How to work with GIT
* branchname should be named after feature/issue along with issue number EX: mycoolability/3 (where 3 is issue number)
* Create own branch to work on (git checkout -b "branchname"
* Checkout branch to work on (git checkout "branchname"
* Work on branch and GTFO gamescene
* Pushing: make sure u in ur branch push by: (git push origin "branchname")

## How to work on github
* create pull-request for ur branch into (dev-branch) (needs to be changed top left corner)
* someone could approve but whatever
* press "files changed"
* press "review changes"
* make sure correct merges are made
* click merge
* press merge pull request
* voila devbranch should be uptodate with ur branch
* checkout devbranch on git and pull by (git pull origin devbranch) (to make sure someone elses changes are locally at u now)
